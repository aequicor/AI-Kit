## Memory (KnowledgeOS)

Long-term memory is in a KnowledgeOS vault accessed via MCP. Prefer these
over filesystem grep when you need context outside the current task:

- `search_docs(query, filters?)` — semantic + BM25 search. Filter shape:
  `{"fm.<key>": "<value>"}`. Use first when context is missing.
- `get_doc(path)` — fetch one document by vault-relative path.
- `list_docs(directory?)` — enumerate documents under a vault directory.
- `write_doc(path, content, frontmatter?)` — create. Use `[[other-doc]]`
  wikilinks for cross-refs (auto-loaded on retrieval). Frontmatter keys
  become `fm.<key>` filters.
- `update_doc(path, content, preserve_frontmatter?)` — modify existing.
  Pass `preserve_frontmatter: true` for body-only edits.

Logical key → frontmatter filter (matches manifest layout):
- feature → `{"fm.type": "domain", "fm.scope": "feature"}`
- subsystem → `{"fm.type": "reference", "fm.scope": "subsystem"}`
- decision → `{"fm.type": "decision"}`
- tech-debt → `{"fm.type": "tech-debt"}`
- documentation → `{"fm.type": "documentation"}`

If an MCP call errors or the server is unreachable, fall back to Read/Grep
on `vault/specs/`. Do not block the task on a memory failure — log it and
proceed.

## Memory (filesystem)

Long-term memory is plain markdown at `vault/specs/`:
- features → `vault/specs/features/<module>/<feature>/spec.md`
- subsystems → `vault/specs/subsystems/<name>.md`
- decisions → `vault/specs/DECISIONS.md`
- tech-debt → `vault/specs/tech-debt/<module>/<slug>.md`
- documentation → `vault/specs/guidelines/<module>/<topic>.md`

Read with Read/Grep. Write with the host's edit/write tools. KnowledgeOS
is not enabled — there is no semantic search, no wikilink expansion, no
reranking. List the vault before claiming a document is missing.
