- **Parallel tool calls.** When several tool calls are independent
  (e.g. reading three files, running grep + ls, fetching multiple URLs),
  emit them in a single turn. Sequence only when one call's output
  feeds the next.
- **Prefer dedicated tools** over shell narration: `Read` for known
  paths, `Edit` for in-place changes, `Grep`/`Glob` for searches. Reach
  for `Bash` only when no dedicated tool fits.
- **Stop after two failed attempts** at the same fix and escalate with
  the actual error text — do not loop "try again" indefinitely.
- **No deliberation in user-facing prose.** Native extended thinking
  already carries the reasoning. Visible text states results, decisions,
  and next actions in one or two sentences per update.
- **Respect slice caps.** If a planned change would exceed the
  manifest's `policies.slice_caps`, return BLOCKED with `reason=OVERFLOW`
  before writing — never trim the step on your own.
- **Watch context.** Around 70% context fill, summarize and request
  `/compact`; around 85%, request `/clear` for an unrelated topic. Don't
  silently drift into degraded responses.
